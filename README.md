# Hexal-Engine
JavaScript Canvas engine for rendering 2.5D hexagonal-tile game boards of arbitrary depth.

## Note Bene

I wrote this a long time ago, before I knew anything. The code is... rough, to put it favorably.

I've noticed two people have branched the code. It's an interesting project and I'd be happy to pick it back up to get it in better working condition. Create an issue or e-mail me at TomASimmons@gmail.com if you are interested in seeing this project become better designed. I'm up for the challenge, I still have my notes. :) It would probably be a ground-up rebuild, though, using the original for reference. (There is a lot of logic to calculate the location of pixel boundaries based on a rigid assumption about hexagon shape, for example, that is neither _simple_ nor _maintainable_. It should be replaced with proper sprite loading. There are plenty of other examples of omg-why in this repository.)

Thanks for your interest!

# Hexal-Engine
JavaScript Canvas engine for rendering 2.5D hexagonal-tile game boards of arbitrary depth.

## Note Bene

This program was made a while ago before I knew much about software design or quality, and as such is very rough. I periodically prod the code towards sanity when the mood strikes, but I have other, higher-priority interests, so I make no promises.

# Hexal-Engine
JavaScript Canvas engine for rendering 2.5D hexagonal-tile game boards of arbitrary depth.

## Note Bene

This program was made a while ago before I knew much about software design or quality, and as such is very rough. However, because a few people have checked it out and because it will probably be fun, I've started dusting Hexal off to make it into something a little nicer.

Work will begin by organizing and updating the build process into something that resembles sanity. After that I will begin modularizing the hexal-core module, and finally brush up the demo. I will try to back-fill tests as I go.

I will be working largely out of master when possible.

Thanks for your interest!
